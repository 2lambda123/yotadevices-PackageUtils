# PackageUtils
The **PackageUtils** contains methods to get an information about installed applications
and to access their `meta-data` and resources such as values, drawables, icons etc.
Access all methods through the `PackageUtils.getInstance()` method. To initialize the
`PackageUtils` you should call the `PackageUtils.instantiate(PackageManager)` instead of
using the constructor.
